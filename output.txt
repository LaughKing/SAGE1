[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Mitochondria are responsible for protein synthesis.
[A] Answer  : False

Mitochondria play a key role in cellular energy production, but they are not primarily responsible for protein synthesis. That function is mainly carried out by ribosomes, particularly those found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in the cytoplasm. Mitochondria do contain some ribosomes and can synthesize some of their own proteins, but this is a specialized subset and not the general process of protein synthesis within the cell.
