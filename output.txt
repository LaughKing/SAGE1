[Q] Question: Question: Answer this question use True or False. Does mitosis produce four genetically distinct daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes of the original cell?
[A] Answer  : False. Mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the original cell (diploid). It is meiosis that produces four genetically distinct daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes of the original cell (haploid).

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Meiosis produces four genetically identical daughter cells.
[A] Answer  : False

Meiosis results in four daughter cells that are genetically diverse, not identical, as crossing over and random assortment of chromosomes contribute to genetic variation.

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Mitochondria are responsible for protein synthesis.
[A] Answer  : False

Mitochondria play a key role in cellular energy production, but they are not primarily responsible for protein synthesis. That function is mainly carried out by ribosomes, particularly those found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in the cytoplasm. Mitochondria do contain some ribosomes and can synthesize some of their own proteins, but this is a specialized subset and not the general process of protein synthesis within the cell.

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Plants perform both photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
[A] Answer  : True

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: DNA replication occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
[A] Answer  : False

DNA replication primarily occurs during the S (synthesis) phase of the cell cycle, not the G1 (first gap) phase. During the G1 phase, the cell grows and performs normal functions, and prepares to enter the S phase where DNA replication takes place.

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Alleles are different forms of the same gene.
[A] Answer  : True

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Osmosis requires ATP energy.
[A] Answer  : False. Osmosis is a passive process that does not require ATP energy. It involves the movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration.

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Humans have 46 chromosomes in their gametes.
[A] Answer  : False

Humans typically have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in their somatic (body) cells. In gametes (egg and sperm cells), which are reproductive cells, the number of chromosomes is halved to 23, so that when fertilization occurs, the resulting zygote has the full complement of 46 chromosomes.
----------------------------------------
[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Crossing over occurs during metaphase I of meiosis.
[A] Answer  : False

Crossing over, which is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, typically occurs during prophase I of meiosis, specifically in a phase known as pachytene, which is part of prophase I. It does not occur during metaphase I.

[Q] Question: Question: Answer with True or False: Enzymes increase activation energy of reactions.
[A] Answer  : False

Enzymes lower the activation energy of reactions, thereby increasing the rate at which reactions occur.
