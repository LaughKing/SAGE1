# Enhancement Issue: Create DAG Node Factory for Improved Serialization and Architecture

## Issue Title
**[Enhancement] Implement DAG Node Factory Pattern for Better Serialization and Cleaner Architecture**

## Background

Currently, the DAG node creation logic is scattered across multiple components (`MixedDAG`, `Transformation`, `Compiler`), which creates several issues:

1. **Serialization Problems**: Ray actors require all components to be serializable, but current node creation involves complex object graphs
2. **Tight Coupling**: `MixedDAG.create_node_instance()` directly handles platform-specific logic
3. **Inconsistent Creation**: Node creation logic is duplicated and inconsistent across different execution platforms
4. **Debugging Difficulty**: Node creation errors are hard to trace due to scattered logic

## Proposed Solution

Implement a **DAG Node Factory Pattern** where:
- `Compiler` creates serializable `DAGNodeFactory` instances for each graph node
- `DAGNodeFactory` encapsulates all information needed to create DAG nodes
- `MixedDAG` uses these factories to create actual node instances
- Platform-specific logic is centralized within the factory

## Benefits

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Improvements**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused responsibility
  - `Compiler`: Graph analysis and factory creation
  - `DAGNodeFactory`: Node instantiation logic
  - `MixedDAG`: Execution coordination
- **Reduced Coupling**: Eliminates direct dependencies between compilation and execution phases
- **Cleaner Abstractions**: Clear separation between logical graph representation and physical execution

### üîÑ **Serialization Benefits**
- **Ray Compatibility**: Factory objects contain only serializable data (classes, primitives)
- **Lazy Instantiation**: Nodes are created only when needed, reducing memory footprint
- **Cross-Process Safety**: Factories can be safely passed between Ray actors and processes

### üêõ **Debugging & Maintenance**
- **Centralized Logic**: All node creation logic in one place, easier to debug and modify
- **Better Error Handling**: Factory pattern allows for better error reporting and recovery
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same creation logic across local and distributed environments

### ‚ö° **Performance Improvements**
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Factories are lightweight compared to full node instances
- **Faster Compilation**: Graph compilation doesn't need to create heavy runtime objects
- **Better Resource Management**: Nodes can be created/destroyed on demand

### üîß **Development Experience**
- **Easier Testing**: Factory pattern makes unit testing much simpler
- **Better Documentation**: Clear interfaces make the codebase more self-documenting
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new node types or platforms

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Factory Infrastructure
```python
# New files to create:
- sage_core/core/compiler/node_factory.py
- sage_runtime/function/factory.py (enhanced)
```

### Phase 2: Modify Existing Components
```python
# Files to modify:
- sage_core/core/compiler/compiler.py
- sage_runtime/mixed_dag.py
- sage_core/api/transformation.py
- sage_runtime/executor/ray_dag_node.py
- sage_runtime/executor/local_dag_node.py
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Migration
- Update existing tests to use factory pattern
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates

## Code Examples

### Before (Current Architecture)
```python
# Scattered node creation logic
def create_node_instance(self, graph_node: GraphNode, env: BaseEnvironment):
    if env.platform == PlatformType.REMOTE:
        node = RayDAGNode(graph_node, transformation, memory_collection, env_name=env.name)
    else:
        node = LocalDAGNode(graph_node, transformation, memory_collection, env_name=env.name)
    return node
```

### After (Factory Pattern)
```python
# Centralized, serializable factory
class DAGNodeFactory:
    def create_node(self, env, graph_node, platform_type="local"):
        if platform_type == "remote":
            return RayDAGNode(self.create_config())
        else:
            return LocalDAGNode(self.create_config())

# In Compiler
graph_node.node_factory = DAGNodeFactory(transformation, node_name, parallel_index)

# In MixedDAG
self.nodes = graph.create_dag_nodes(env, platform_type)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All DAG node creation goes through factory pattern
- [ ] Ray serialization works without custom `__getstate__`/`__setstate__`
- [ ] No regression in performance or functionality
- [ ] Unit tests cover factory pattern behavior
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture
- [ ] Both local and distributed execution work seamlessly
