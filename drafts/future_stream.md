## Feature Issue: Support Feedback Edges in DAG Construction

### Summary
Add support for feedback edges in the pipeline DAG to enable cyclic data processing patterns and iterative computations, with special focus on complex multiagent task orchestration and feedback-driven pipeline optimization.

### Strategic Importance for Multiagent Systems
This feature is crucial for advancing complex multiagent task orchestration and feedback-driven pipeline optimization:

- **Iterative Multiagent Coordination**: Enable agents to iteratively refine their outputs based on feedback from other agents, creating sophisticated coordination patterns
- **Dynamic Resource Optimization**: Allow pipelines to adaptively optimize resource allocation (vector databases, memory collections, compute resources) based on real-time feedback from execution results
- **Parallel Feedback Processing**: Support concurrent feedback loops where multiple agents can simultaneously process and refine data, leveraging vector databases and memory systems for efficient parallel optimization
- **Adaptive Pipeline Orchestration**: Enable pipelines to self-modify and optimize their execution patterns based on performance feedback, particularly valuable for long-running multiagent workflows

By supporting feedback edges, we can build more intelligent and adaptive systems that continuously improve their performance through iterative refinement, making them ideal for complex multiagent scenarios where coordination and optimization are key.

### Problem Statement
Currently, the pipeline DAG only supports acyclic graphs where data flows in one direction. However, many real-world scenarios require feedback loops, such as:
- Iterative machine learning algorithms
- Control systems with feedback mechanisms  
- Streaming applications that need to reference previous results
- Recursive data processing patterns

### Proposed Solution

#### API Design
```python
# 1. Declare a future stream (placeholder)
future_stream = env.from_future(name="feedback_loop")

# 2. Use the future stream in pipeline construction
source_stream = env.from_source(SomeSource)
processed_stream = source_stream.map(ProcessFunction).connect(future_stream).comap(CombineFunction)

# 3. Fill the future stream with actual transformation
result_stream = processed_stream.filter(FilterFunction)
result_stream.fill_future(future_stream)  # Creates the feedback edge
```

#### Implementation Components

1. **FutureTransformation Class**
   ```python
   class FutureTransformation(BaseTransformation):
       def __init__(self, env: BaseEnvironment, name: str):
           # Special transformation that acts as a placeholder
           self.is_future = True
           self.filled = False
           self.actual_transformation = None
   ```

2. **Environment.from_future() Method**
   ```python
   def from_future(self, name: str) -> DataStream:
       """Create a future stream placeholder for feedback edges"""
       transformation = FutureTransformation(self, name)
       self._pipeline.append(transformation)
       return DataStream(self, transformation)
   ```

3. **DataStream.fill_future() Method**
   ```python
   def fill_future(self, future_stream: DataStream) -> None:
       """Fill a future stream with current transformation"""
       if not future_stream.transformation.is_future:
           raise ValueError("Target must be a future stream")
       
       future_trans = future_stream.transformation
       future_trans.actual_transformation = self.transformation
       future_trans.filled = True
       
       # Redirect all downstreams of future to current transformation
       self._redirect_connections(future_trans, self.transformation)
   ```

### Technical Considerations

#### DAG Compilation
- The compiler needs to detect and handle cycles properly
- Implement topological sorting with cycle detection
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous feedback patterns

#### Runtime Execution
- Handle initialization of feedback loops (cold start problem)
- Implement buffering mechanisms for feedback data
- Prevent infinite loops and provide termination conditions

#### Memory Management
- Manage circular references in the DAG
- Implement proper cleanup when pipelines are stopped
- Handle memory pressure from buffered feedback data

### Example Use Cases

#### 1. Iterative Processing
```python
env = LocalEnvironment()

# Declare feedback for iteration
iteration_feedback = env.from_future("iteration_loop")

# Main processing pipeline
data_stream = env.from_source(DataSource)
processed = data_stream.connect(iteration_feedback).comap(IterativeProcessor)

# Convergence check and feedback
converged = processed.filter(ConvergenceCheck)
not_converged = processed.filter(lambda x: not ConvergenceCheck.call(x))

# Create feedback loop
not_converged.fill_future(iteration_feedback)

# Final output
converged.sink(ResultSink)
```

#### 2. Control System
```python
env = LocalEnvironment()

# Sensor feedback
sensor_feedback = env.from_future("sensor_feedback")

# Control loop
setpoint = env.from_source(SetpointSource)
control_signal = setpoint.connect(sensor_feedback).comap(PIDController)
output = control_signal.map(ActuatorFunction)

# Sensor measurement (creates feedback)
measurement = output.map(SensorFunction)
measurement.fill_future(sensor_feedback)
```

### Implementation Plan

   - Implement cycle detection and validation
   - Add support for feedback edge resolution

3. **Phase 3: Runtime Support**

   - Add initialization strategies for feedback loops
   - Handle termination and cleanup

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Documentation**
   - Unit tests for feedback edge scenarios
   - Integration tests with example use cases
   - Documentation and usage examples

### Acceptance Criteria
