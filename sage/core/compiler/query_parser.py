---Goal---
Determine the intent behind a natural language query. You must classify the query into **one** of the following predefined intent types:

- question-answering: Asking a specific, contextual or precise question based on the provided text or document.
- summarization: Asking to condense or extract key points from a body of content.
- generation: Asking to create new content, ideas, names, taglines, etc.
- classification: Asking to categorize or label the input.
- transformation: Asking to rephrase, simplify, translate, or convert the input.
- retrieval: Asking for general knowledge, broad factual info, or well-known concepts.
- other: If none of the above clearly apply.

---Instructions---
1. Carefully read the query and its context.
2. Choose the most appropriate intent from the list.
3. Respond with one word only. Do not explain or comment.
Output format: <intent>

---Examples---
{examples_block}

---Query to Process---
Context: {context if context else "None"}
Query: {natural_query}
