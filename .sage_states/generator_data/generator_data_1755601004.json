I'll do my best to answer your question accurately.\n\nBased on my research, \"Sthree Sahasam\" and \"That Malicious Age\" are not from the same country. \"Sthree Sahasam\" is a 2016 Indian Tamil-language film directed by G.R. Adithya, and \"That Malicious Age\" is a 2019 Japanese film directed by RyÅ«ta Inoue. Therefore, the answer to your question is no, they are not from the same country.",
