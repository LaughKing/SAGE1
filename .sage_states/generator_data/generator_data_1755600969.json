He had suffered from a series of strokes in the previous years, and his health had been declining gradually.\n\nSir Josiah Mason was a prominent industrialist and philanthropist who founded the university in 1880 with the aim of providing higher education to the working class. He was a successful businessman and had made his fortune in the manufacture of steel and other industries. He was also a committed Methodist and believed that education was key to improving the lives of individuals and society as a whole.\n\nAfter his death, Mason's legacy lived on through the university, which has grown to become one of the leading institutions of higher learning in the UK. The university's campus is home to a statue of Mason, and his legacy is celebrated through various events and initiatives.",
