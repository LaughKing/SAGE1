    "response": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on my research, Rhescuporis II and McAllister Hull are not from the same nationality. Rhescuporis II is believed to have been a king of the Bosporan Kingdom, which was located in present-day Crimea, Ukraine, while McAllister Hull is a fictional character from the \"Horus Heresy\" series of science fiction novels, which is set in a far-future science fiction universe. Therefore, they do not share the same nationality.",
