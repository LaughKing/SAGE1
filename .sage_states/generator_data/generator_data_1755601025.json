    "response": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the information provided, the movies \"Carnival of Souls\" and \"Uvanga\" are not from the same country.\n\n\"Carnival of Souls\" is a 1962 American horror film, directed by Herk Harvey and produced by Samuel Z. Arkoff. It was filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, and tells the story of a young woman who is haunted by ghosts after a car accident.\n\n\"Uvanga\" is a 2019 Mongolian horror film, directed by Byambasuren Davaa and produced by Batmagnai Davaa. It was filmed in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and tells the story of a young woman who is haunted by a malevolent spirit after a car accident.\n\nSince the two films were produced in different countries (the United States and Mongolia), they are not from the same country. I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
