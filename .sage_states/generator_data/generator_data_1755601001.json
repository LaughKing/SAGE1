    "response": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nThe 1954 film \"Bait\" was directed by Charles Crichton, who was a British film director. Dharm Adhikari is a Nepali film director, and his films are primarily produced in Nepal. Therefore, the answer to your question is no, the directors of these two films do not come from the same country.",
