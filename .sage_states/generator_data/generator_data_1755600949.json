    "response": "  Sure thing! Based on my research, Bloody Birthday is a 1981 American horror film directed by Ed Hunt, while The Beckoning Silence is a 2018 Australian horror film directed by Andrew Deocket. Therefore, no, these two movies do not originate from the same country. Bloody Birthday is an American film, while The Beckoning Silence is an Australian film.",
