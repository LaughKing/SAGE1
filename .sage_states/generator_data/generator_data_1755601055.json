I'd be happy to help you with your question.\n\nBoth \"Ek Paheli\" and \"When Father Was Away on Business\" are films directed by the same person, so neither film has a director who was born earlier. Both films were directed by the Indian filmmaker, Kalpana Lajmi.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is that neither film has a director who was born earlier. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
