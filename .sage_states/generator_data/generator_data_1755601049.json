    "response": "  Hello! I'd be happy to help answer your question.\n\nThe director of the film The Monster Squad, Fred Dekker, is an American film director, writer, and producer. He is known for his work on several films, including The Monster Squad, but he is not the director of the 2011 film The Cup.\n\nThe director of The Cup (2011 film) is a different person, and I couldn't find any information that suggests that Fred Dekker and the director of The Cup are from the same country. So, the answer to your question is no, they are not from the same country.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
